# 👋 Hi, I'm Jonah

Security Automation & AI Engineer | Building the future of secure, intelligent systems

I blend **cybersecurity**, **AI engineering**, and **automation** to create practical tools that solve real problems. My background in IT, education, and hands-on security work gives me a unique skillset: I understand how systems break, how people behave, and how to design technology that actually works in the real world.

Right now, my focus is on **AI-driven security tooling**, **RAG pipelines**, and **threat automation systems**—the intersection where the industry is moving fastest.

## What I’m Working On

### **1. The Christian Project — Secure AI Q&A System for Doctrinal Content**

A full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform built with:

* FAISS vector search
* Clean embedding pipelines
* Structured doctrinal datasets
* FastAPI backend
* Vercel frontend
* OpenAI Chat Completions fallback logic

This project showcases system design, model safety, clean data engineering, and deployment across multiple platforms.

🔗 *Repo coming soon — currently polishing documentation.*

### **2. Security Automation Case Study — Threat Enrichment Pipeline**

A proof-of-concept automation system integrating:

* IP log extraction
* VirusTotal enrichment
* GeoIP lookup
* Google Sheets logging
* Slack alerting
* Repeat-offender tracking

Originally prototyped in n8n, later redesigned with CLI-based workflows. Demonstrates how I think about **security automation**, **orchestration**, and **real-world incident pipelines**.

### **3. Defensive Home Lab — Practical Security Engineering**

Even though this project is paused until I have a dedicated home space, I’ve already built and configured:

* Suricata IDS
* Wazuh SIEM
* fail2ban jail rules
* Structured log forwarding
* UFW firewall controls
* Segmented attacker/defender VM setup
* Simulated brute force + detection exercises

This serves as a showcase of hands-on defensive knowledge and real-world tool experience.

## 🧠 What I Bring to the Table

* **Strong Security Foundations** — Practical experience with SIEMs, IDS/IPS, firewalls, network monitoring, attack simulation.
* **AI Engineering** — RAG pipelines, embeddings, prompt design, model safety guidelines, API integration.
* **Automation Mindset** — Whether using cloud tools or pure CLI, I build systems that reduce repetitive work and enhance visibility.
* **Full-Stack Capability** — API development, deployments, frontend integration, cloud services, and architectural design.
* **Builder Energy** — I ship, iterate, break, rebuild, and refine. That’s what engineering is.

## 🧭 My Mission

To become a leading **Security Automation Engineer** with deep specialization in **AI systems**, building tools that protect, streamline, and empower organizations in an AI-driven world.

The next decade belongs to engineers who understand **security + AI + automation**.
That’s the lane I’m carving.
